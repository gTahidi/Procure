# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature replaces the current Auth0-based authentication system with a simple email/password authentication system while maintaining the existing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) functionality. The system will provide secure user registration, login, and session management without relying on external identity providers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register with my email and password, so that I can create an account and access the procurement system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a valid email and password THEN the system SHALL create a new user account
2. WHEN a user provides an email that already exists THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message
3. WHEN a user provides an invalid email format THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
4. WHEN a user provides a password shorter than 8 characters THEN the system SHALL return a password strength error
5. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL assign the default role of "requester"
6. WHEN a user successfully registers THEN the system SHALL hash and store the password securely

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to log in with my email and password, so that I can access my account and use the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides correct email and password credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user successfully
2. WHEN a user provides incorrect credentials THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
3. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL generate a secure session token
4. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL return user profile information including role
5. WHEN a user account is inactive THEN the system SHALL deny login access

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want my session to be maintained securely, so that I don't have to re-login frequently while using the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes API requests THEN the system SHALL validate the session token
2. WHEN a session token is valid THEN the system SHALL allow access to protected resources
3. WHEN a session token is expired or invalid THEN the system SHALL return an unauthorized error
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session token
5. WHEN a session token expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to maintain role-based access control, so that users can only access features appropriate to their role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL include their role in the session context
2. WHEN a user accesses a protected resource THEN the system SHALL verify their role permissions
3. WHEN a user's role is "requester" THEN they SHALL have access to requisition creation and viewing
4. WHEN a user's role is "admin" THEN they SHALL have access to all system features
5. WHEN a user's role is "supplier" THEN they SHALL have access to tender and bid features

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to change my password, so that I can maintain account security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides their current password and a new password THEN the system SHALL update their password
2. WHEN a user provides an incorrect current password THEN the system SHALL return an authentication error
3. WHEN a user provides a new password that doesn't meet requirements THEN the system SHALL return a validation error
4. WHEN a password is successfully changed THEN the system SHALL hash and store the new password securely
5. WHEN a password is changed THEN the system SHALL invalidate existing sessions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to reset my password if I forget it, so that I can regain access to my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests a password reset THEN the system SHALL generate a secure reset token
2. WHEN a reset token is generated THEN the system SHALL send a reset email to the user
3. WHEN a user uses a valid reset token THEN the system SHALL allow password reset
4. WHEN a reset token is expired or invalid THEN the system SHALL deny the reset request
5. WHEN a password is successfully reset THEN the system SHALL invalidate the reset token

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system, I want to maintain backward compatibility with existing user data, so that current users can continue using the system without data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating from Auth0 THEN the system SHALL preserve existing user records
2. WHEN migrating user data THEN the system SHALL maintain user roles and permissions
3. WHEN existing users first log in THEN the system SHALL prompt them to set a password
4. WHEN user migration is complete THEN all existing functionality SHALL work as before
5. WHEN migration occurs THEN user IDs and relationships SHALL remain unchanged
